### Teaching

An anthropological perspective is an integral part of a college studentâ€™s education and will serve them well ass they become the next generation of student-scholars. In class I direct content towards a better understanding of the causes and consequences of human variation, equipping students with the skills to apply anthropological concepts to their daily lives.
