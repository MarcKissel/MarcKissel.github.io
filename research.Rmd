##My research

## Symoblic thought

My postdoc work at the Univeristy of Notre Dame involved creating a database of
the evidence of human symbol-making. When creating it, we realized that it
would be helpful to make it open-source. If you are interested, please check out
[this link] (https://marckissel.shinyapps.io/wisdom_database/).


```{r,  include=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(tidyr)
library(leaflet)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

pal3 <- colorFactor(topo.colors(10),
                    domain  = c("45-99", "100-199", "200-299", "300-399", "400-499", "500-599", "600+", "NoDate")
)
new_data <- read_csv("Setting_up_for_citations.csv")
new_df <- new_data %>% unite(Artifact_present,Artifact_Class, Present, sep="_" ) 
new_df_selected <- new_df %>% select(Site_name:citation)
df_2 <- new_df_selected
df_2$group <- factor(df_2$Group, levels = c( "45-99", "100-199", "200-299", "300-399", "400-499", "500-599", "600+", "NoDate"))
temp_date <- df_2 %>% spread(key = Artifact_present, value =citation) #put table into right format for dates
temp_date2 <- temp_date %>% select(Site_name:Hominin) # select only needed tables to display
full_table <- temp_date %>% select(Site_name:Group, ends_with("yes") ) #table for full search

a <- leaflet(full_table) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude, popup = ~as.character(Site_name), color = ~pal3(Group), stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5 ) %>%
  addLegend("topright", pal=pal3, values =~Group, title = "ages in ka")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
