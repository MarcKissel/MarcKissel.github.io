## All about me

I'm a paleoanthropologist interested in the causes and consequences of human evolution. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Univeristy of Notre Dame](http://anthropology.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-by-alpha/marc-kissel/) but will be moving to [Appalachian State University](https://anthro.appstate.edu/) in the Fall and very excited to start working there!
